# healthy-programmer
A Python program to remind a programmer to take breaks during coding.
Coders work non-stop for hours in front of the computer, leading to bad posture, dehydration and eye issues.
In order to adopt healthy practices, I designed this program to remind the user to take breaks and freshen up.
# The reminders
Reminder to drink 1 glass of water, every thirty minutes, starting from 9 AM.
Reminder to exercise the eyes, every thirty minutes, starting from 9:15 AM.
Reminder to exercise the body, every forty-five minutes, starting from 9:15 AM.
Program runs from 9AM to 5PM only
